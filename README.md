# MadLibsGenerator
MadLibsGenerator is my first Python project, based on a popular game. The player gives random words matching the describtions (like verb, noun, etc.) without knowing 
the whole text. After inputing all the words, the computer shows the generated Mad Lib and the player can finally read the story with his words put in corresponding blanks.
I plan on doing few different versions, so the player can choose the one they would like to play. 

I am still learning the language, so the code may not be perfect.
